          <p class="experience_summary">
              I currently work as a Software Engineer at Fannie Mae, primarily focusing on backend development using Java/Python. Right now, I work closely with the Multifamily Tech team to maintain and implement new functionality for our eServicing Application. Previously, I lead a proof-of-concept project which integrated machine learning into our Dev Ops toolchain.

              • Led a team to implement machine learning algorithms into the Jenkins Pipeline in order to prevent downtime, predict future crashes, and mitigate risk
              • Developed a POC to accelerate the process of migrating eServicing to a modern UI using AngularJS
              • Transitioned eServicing back end service calls from EJBs to a REST API</p>

          <p class="experience_summary">I cofounded Upward to allow professionals to interact better with each other in a work-based environment. My main role was backend development, where I led and maintained the production of backend services using endpoints written in Node.js and Express. I also managed a database of users, messages, and emails using MongoDB, as well as created an innovative search engine using Elasticsearch.</p>

          <p class="experience_summary">Kaiser Permanente offered my first real world experience in tech. As a Software Engineer intern, most of my summer was spent developing OneCare, an iOS app that allowed employees to report company-wide facility issues using a snap & and share technique, similar to Instagram. It was built using the Intel XDK to support cross-platform scalability, and the beta has been deployed in the mid-Atlantic region of Kaiser. Piloting this app provided a great learning experience and heightened my interest in mobile development.</p>
